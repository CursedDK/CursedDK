# Hi, I'm CursedDK 👋

I'm a full-stack developer mostly working with **C#** and **TypeScript (Angular)**, with the occasional dive into **C++** for game dev experiments.

- 🔭 Crafting an appointment creator in Angular by day, and world-building a 3D game in Unreal Engine by night
- 🏢 Recently finished a site for a German staffing company: [klimbimgmbh.de](https://klimbimgmbh.de)
- 🎮 I love game development but rarely finish the projects I start 😅
- 🌱 Learning: better architecture patterns and game development (in-depth)
- 📫 How to reach me: **curseddk14@gmail.com** or through my Website 🌐 [dimitriskgm.me](https://dimitriskgm.me)
- 💬 Always open to feedback and constructive criticism — improvement never stops.

> Clean code, shipped features, and unfinished game prototypes — the dev life.
